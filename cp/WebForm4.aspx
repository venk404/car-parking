                                         A car parking system is a mechanical device that multiplies parking capacity inside a parking lot.
                    Parking systems are generally powered by electric motors or hydraulic pumps that move vehicles into
                    a storage position.Car parking systems may be traditional or automated. Automatic multi-storey 
                    automated car park systems are less expensive per parking slot,since they tend to require less building 
                    volumeand less ground area than a conventional facility with the same capacity. In the long term, 
                    automated car parking systems are likely to be more cost effective than traditional parking garages.
                    Car parking systems reduce exhaust gas cars need not drive around in search of street parking spaces.
